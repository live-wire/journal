#### Profitability & Funding
- Churn = people leaving your product. (Not using it anymore).
- Churn rate = `(churn / (initial number + clients acquired)) * 100`
- Conversion = `Conversion rate = (conversions / total visitors) * 100`
- Usual conversion rates:
	- Casual games: `2%`
	- Freemium: `3-5%`
	- Friend Finder: `10-22%`
	- Children social networks: `20%`
	- Money making/guaranteed like trading, dione etc.: `70%`
- Invest in Knowledge needed by customer to use your product. Increase user knowledge or decrease user knowledge needed.
- Magic moment after landing on your page should not be very far away.

#### Pricing
- [Kevin Hale Video](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/6h-startup-pricing-101)
- Where to spend vs Growth
	- Acquisition - `1% up = 3.3% growth`
	- Retention - `1% up = 6.7% growth`
	- Monetization - `1% up = 12.7% growth`
- Cost plus pricing vs Value based pricing.
- Growth starts after the first 2 to 5 % of the potential market is covered by you (the early adopters - not mature themselves).
- Getting someone (mature customers) to change their pattern is difficult.
- Solution = play with prices till you get the max revenue. (Sales and conversions will go down when you increase price, but the revenue might increase).
- Low complexity --- High Complexity, Low price ---- High price. Imagine a grid with these axes.
	- Self serve: <2k per year Low complexity low price
	- Transactional: 2-10k per year Transactional - Sales cycle = 1-3 months
		- Generating qualified leads
		- Customer support with SLAs
		- Trainings
		- Sales representatives
	- Enterprise: > 25k per year
		- Branding
		- Dedicated Customer Success
		- Sales cycle = 6-12 months
	- High complexity, low price = Dead zone.
- Value = 10x Price. Only then it will be possible to sell to mature customers.
- Raise price by 5% until 20% push back.
- Go after early adopters. Price high. Early adopters don't care about price.

#### Raising money
- Y Combinator tells founders who raise money to act as if it's the last they'll ever get. Because the self-reinforcing nature of this situation works the other way too: the less you need further investment, the easier it is to get. '
- Fatal pinch = 6 months before they're out of business. They expect to avoid that by raising more from investors.
- [link](http://paulgraham.com/aord.html) I propose the following solution: instead of starting to ask too late whether you're default alive or default dead, start asking too early. It's hard to say precisely when the question switches polarity. But it's probably not that dangerous to start worrying too early that you're default dead, whereas it's very dangerous to start worrying too late.
- Growth = revenue growth.
- Beautiful startup growth calculator: [link](http://growth.tlb.org/#_.eyJyZXZHcm93dGgiOjAuMDQwMTE1MTA3OTQzOTg3ODd9). Amazing for calculating profitability and capital needed.
